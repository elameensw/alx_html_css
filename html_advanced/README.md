HTML Advanced!
The next step of this journey, is diving into advanced HTML.
Now we develop our site, referencing a figma mockup of the final result.
We focus on all the html elements first and after that we can add style by creating and linking to a stylesheet.
While working with the figma file, make sure to duplicate it so that you can access all the file's details and use them freely. How to Duplicate
This also makes sure our original file remains unchanged hence it retains its reference integrity, while you are able to experiment with the duplicate.
The fonts to be used are;
Source Sans Pro from San Serif fonts,
Spin Cycle from Display Fonts

- You can preview the rendered website in it's current state, so that you can follow the development in real-time.
- **Happy Coding!**
